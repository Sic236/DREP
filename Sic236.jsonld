I have joined Cardano only when the first NFT collection minted, but ever since I felt in love with this blockchain and its community.\n\nThat marked the moment when I've quit my web2 job as a psychologist in the army under Romanian Intelligence Service department and joined Cardano full time.\n\nNow I wouldn't imagine me working in any other place, Cardano is my home and I want a fruitful career here.\n\nI would do anything it takes to see Cardano thriving and fulfilling it's mission.",
